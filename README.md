BlueFox is a modular mesh network system that uses ESP-32 CAM's that take images of a location every 30 minutes then transmit them back to my home computer via LoRa protocol. The network comprises of end nodes (the ESP CAMs); relay nodes (the LoRa-32 cases outside of my house) ; and the central node (the LoRa-32 at my house). Due to the limited bandwidth of LoRa and the relitave size of the images I decided to change the image to FRAMESIZE_QQVGA in order to make the data needing to be sent to be smaller the code can send larger images it just takes a longer time due to the greater number of packets needing to be sent. Even with the smaller images LoRa cannot send the image with one radio.transmit() so I created hex packets with a header for identification, ending for termination, and checksums to insure all data was received correctly. With this each relay node will collect all the packets for the last one and then move it forward untill it reaches the end. One at the central node it will hex dump all of the data removing headers, endings, and checksums to be copied in to a python script that will remake the image from the hex.
